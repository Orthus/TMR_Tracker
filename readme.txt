Open Panel 0.0.1

Open Panel is an open source control panel to manage game servers. It uses a framework of Rethinkdb, Expressjs, Vue.js, and Nodejs.

Usage:

Install Openpanel

run the install.sh with sudo or root

It will create an user "OpenPanel"
a folder called "Services"


Running Openpanel

In the Services folder, you will need to create a folder called Service_# and inside of that you will need to create a Service.json file. I have provided a template file to make the setup of services streamlined.
